# Backstory

Let's pretend there once lived a Brewers fan. This Brewers fan had two friends. One friend was a Cardinals fan and one friend was a Cubs fan. The Brewers fan approached these two friends and offered them a season long bet. The details of the bet are below.

 - Every game that his team (Brewers) beats your team (Cardianls/Cub) he receives a dollar. Everytime his team (Brewers) loses to your team (Cardinals/Cubs) he pays you a dollar.
 - One additional dollar is paid to the fan whos team win the series
 - One additional dollar is paid to the fan of a team who sweep the other team.

 The two friends agreed and also agreed to the bet with each other and so was born this three way bet.

 # What is this?

 As a fan of _______ I was curious how well I would have performed on this bet in years past. This repo contains a simple python script that allows you to input your team and year in the top of the script and it will determine final payouts for a season based on the rules above.

 This script is focused on Cardinals, Brewers, and Cubs but could be altered to incorporate other teams pretty easily.
